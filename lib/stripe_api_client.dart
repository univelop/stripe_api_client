/// Stripe API Client
/// 
/// This package provides a Dart client for the Stripe API, automatically
/// generated from the official Stripe OpenAPI specification.
/// 
/// The generated code is located in the lib/ directory and includes:
/// - API client classes in lib/api/
/// - Data models in lib/model/
/// - Authentication utilities in lib/auth/
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:stripe_api_client/api.dart';
/// 
/// // Use the generated API client
/// ```
library stripe_api_client;

// Export the generated API (these files are created during code generation)
// Uncomment after running: dart run build_runner build
// export 'api.dart';
// export 'openapi.dart';
